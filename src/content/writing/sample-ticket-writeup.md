This is a sample write-up. Replace it with real posts about tickets, experiments, or anything you’ve been working on.

Use **Markdown** as usual. You can add:

- Bullet lists
- Code snippets
- Links and images

Keep each post in `src/content/writing/` with a `.md` file. The filename (without `.md`) becomes the URL slug, e.g. `my-ticket.md` → `/writing/my-ticket`.
