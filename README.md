## ✨ Overview

This site serves as my public professional profile:

- CV-style overview
- Selected work and systems
- Contact details
- Future home for writing and case studies

The goal is to keep the site:

- fast
- readable
- low-maintenance
- easy to extend over time

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Astro** — static-first framework
- **TypeScript** — type safety
- **Biome** — formatting and linting
- **Vercel** — hosting and CI/CD

Astro’s islands architecture keeps JavaScript to a minimum while allowing interactivity where needed.

## 🌍 Deployment

The project is deployed on **Vercel**.

- Every push to `main` triggers a production deployment
- Preview deployments are created automatically for pull requests

## 🔮 Future Improvements
